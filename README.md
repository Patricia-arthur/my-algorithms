# Algorithm Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal practice codes and implementations
of fundamental programming and algorithmic problems.

The goal of this repository is to improve my understanding of:
- Algorithmic thinking
- Problem-solving techniques
- Python programming
- Data structures and numerical computation

## Purpose

This repository is meant for:
- Learning and experimentation
- Tracking my coding progress over time
- Practicing algorithm implementation from scratch

It is not intended to be a polished library, but a learning workspace.
